\begin{abstract}
This paper considers the use of dependent types to capture information
about dynamic resource usage in a static type system.  Dependent types
allow us to give \remph(explicit) proofs of properties with a program; we
present a dependently typed core language $\source$, and define a
framework within this language for representing size metrics and their
properties. We give several examples of size bounded programs within
this framework and show that we can construct proofs of their size
bounds within $\source$.
We further show how the framework handles recursive
higher order functions and sum types, and contrast our system with
previous work based on sized types.

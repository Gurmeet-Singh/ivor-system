\section{Haskell Code}

This appendix contains some of the more important definitions from the
logic theorem prover and functional language implementation. The
complete code for both examples is available from
\url{http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~eb/Ivor}; the code presented here
illustrates the building of complex tactics with \Ivor{}.

\subsection{Propositional Logic}

Two domain specific tactics are needed; firstly 
Secondly, we need a tactic to prove a contradiction as discussed in
section \ref{example1}:

\begin{verbatim}
> contradiction :: String -> String -> Tactic
> contradiction x y = claim (name "false") "False" >+>
>                     induction "false" >+>
>                     (try (fill $ x ++ " " ++ y)
>                           idTac
>                           (fill $ y ++ " " ++ x))
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{\Funl{}}

\label{funlapp}

When building a function definition, we prove a \hdecl{theorem} of the
appropriate type. Then the \hdecl{buildTerm} tactic traverses the
structure of the raw term, constructing a proof of the
theorem.

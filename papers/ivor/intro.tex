\section{Introduction}

\Ivor{} is a tactic-based theorem proving engine with a Haskell
API. Unlike other systems such as \Coq{} \cite{coq-manual} and Agda,
the tactic engine is primarily intended to be used by programs, rather
than a human operator. To this end, the API provides a collection of
primitive tactics and combinators for building new tactics. This
allows easy construction of domain specific tactics, while keeping the
core type theory small and independently checkable.

The primary aim of the library is to support research into generative
programming and resource bounded computation in Hume
(\url{http://www.hume-lang.org/}). In this setting, we have developed a
dependently typed framework for representing program execution cost,
and used the \Ivor{} library to implement domain specific tactics for
constructing programs within this framework. However the library is
more widely applicable, some potential uses being:

\begin{itemize}
\item A core language for a richly typed functional language.
\item The underlying implementation for a theorem prover (see first order
  logic theorem prover example at 
  \url{http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~eb/Ivor}).
\item An implementation framework for a domain specific language requiring
  strong correctness properties.
\end{itemize}

\Ivor{} features a dependent type theory similar to Luo's ECC with
definitions \cite{luo94}, with additional (experimental) multi-stage
programming support~\cite{multi-taha}. Optionally, it can be extended
with heterogenous equality, primitive types and operations, new parser
rules and user defined tactics. By default, all programs in the type
theory terminate, but in the spirit of flexibilty, the library can be
configured to allow general recursion.

Short term things to do:

* Keep track of level in proof state.
* Syntax for equality.
* Elimination with a motive.
* Unit tests - at least check nat.tt, vect.tt, JM equality,
  primitives, simple staging, compiler.
* More readable high level language for function definition. Really
  just has to use tactic engine to translate simple case expressions into
  D-case calls.
* Separate API into several files for clarity.
* Allow call <fn args> _ in raw terms; i.e. allow the typechecker to
  spot recursive calls, rather than needing a tactic to do so.
* Finish compiler by:
  - Finding a method of exporting primitive types
  - Implement compilation of D-Case

Things which could be done to the library, in no particular order
(other than the order I thought of them in...):

* A higher level dependently typed language might be useful (e.g. like
  Coq's language). If not useful, at least fun :).
* Namespace management.
* Some useful error messages from the Parsec parsers would be nice.
* Proper type universes, of some form.
* Generate DRec as well as DElim/DCase.
* Build in Sigma types?

Tactics:

* Injectivity.
* Discriminate.
* Inversion, likewise.
